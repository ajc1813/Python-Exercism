#def proverb():
    #pass

#The function definition given in the editor has no arguements as shown above. But in the tst cases, it is shown 'self.assertEqual(proverb(*input_data, qualifier=None), [])'. So two parameters are added in the function definition:-*input_data and qualifier. *input_data is a list and qualifier is a string
#An empty set is initialized for the proveb
#If the list '*input_data' is empty, empty set is returned
#If the list '*input_data' is non-empty, proverb is calculated as follows
#In case of non-empty list, the last line of proverb is common for all cases. So it is arranged first. The last word of the line is the first element of the list *input_data i.e. input_data[0]. if the qualifier is not 'None', the the second last word of this line is the qualifier. The summary is as follows. When the list 'input_data' is non-empty and the qualifier is 'None', the last line is 'And all for the want of a {input_data[0]}.'. When the list 'input_data' is non-empty and the qualifier is not 'None', the last line is 'And all for the want of a {qualifier} {input_data[0]}.'. Now the list for proverb contains the last line
#If the length of the list is equal to one, the proverb, which now contains the last line, is returned as such
#If the length of the list is greater than one, the proverb is created as follows.Iteration over the one less than the length of the list 'input_data' is done(Reason for using length-1 will be described at the end).For each position in the list 'input_data', element at that position and element following it is taken i.e. for ith position elements 'input_data[i]' and 'input_data[i]' are choosen. Now a line is created as follows 'For want of a {input_data[i]} the {input_data[i+1]} was lost.'. This for the ith position, the corresponding line is 'For want of a {input_data[i]} the {input_data[i+1]} was lost.'. This line is added to the set for proverb. If the iteration over the length of the list then at the last position the last element and element following it is needed which is not available and this causes error. to avoid this length-1 is used which stops iteration at the second last element(In this case, second last element and last element will be used). After creating a line corresponding to a position, it is added to the proverb set. The line corresponding to first position is added before the last line which is already in the set for proverb. The line corresponding to second position is added before the last line and after the line corresponding to the line corresponding to the first position. Thus the line should be added before the last line and after the line corresponding to the previous position i.e. line corresponding to ith position should be before the last line and after the line corresponding to the (i-1)th position. This is achieved by using insert() function with index equal to value of the i
