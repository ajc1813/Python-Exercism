#An empty set and a dictionary(in which each key-value pair indicate the decimal equivalent of the binary number and the corresponding action) is created. If the binary number is "00000", then the empty set is returned. Otherwise a list is created whose elements indicates the indexes at which bit is one. If the list has an element '0', it means the binary number corresponding to 16 is present which means that the reversing operation is to be done. Since no action is specified corrsponding to 16, it should be removed from the list. This is done using for loop. remove(),pop() cannot be used. Now using the new list, corresponding actions are added to the empty list. The actions are obtianed from the dictionary using the index. The addition is done in such a way that the new elments are added at the beginning of the empty list. This is done using insert() function(if append is used element will be added at the end). Thus the list=indicating the actions are obtained. Now if the list of index contains the element "0", then reversing should be done
