#def rows(letter):
    #pass

#Solution is as follows
#First a word is formed whose order is same order of letters from one end of the diamond to the other end. For example if given letter is 'B', then word is 'BAB' and if given letter is 'C', then word is 'CBABC'. For this, the string constant containing uppercase english letters(A to Z) is initialized using string.ascii_uppercase. This string constant is converted into a list using list() function. The index of the given letter in the list of alphabetsthe is found using the index() function. The string constant is sliced as per the index value obtained. This will give the part of the required word from its middle. For example, if the given word is 'C', the required word is 'CBABC' and now we have 'ABC'. Now to obtain the word, the part of the word obatined from the string constant after the first element is sliced and then reversed. This word is added to the word obtained from the string constant which will give the required word
#Then a list is formed for the part of the diamond from top row till the middle row. For forming the diamond, the alphabets from 'A' till the given letter is considered which corresponds to the word obtained from the string constant. For example, if given letter is 'C', then the alphabets A,B,C are used for the diamond. For this and empty string is initialized. This alphabets are compared with the each letter of the word. If both are same the alphabet is added to a string else space is added to the string. This gives the part of the diamond from top row till the middle row
#Next part of the diamond below the middle row is obtained. The part of the diamond below the middle row is the mirror image of the part above the middle row. So the middle row is removed and the remaining list is reversed to obtain the part of the diamond below the middle row. The two parts are added to give the diamond
