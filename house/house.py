#The characteristics of the rhyme is as follows. First charcteristics is that each verse in the rhyme will contain same number of lines as the verse number i.e. nth verse will contain n lines. Second characteristics is that each verse can be obtained from the previous verse by replacing the first line of the previous verse with new two lines i.e. for nth verse can be obtained by replacing the first line of the (n-1)th verse with two new lines
#Solution of the exercise is as follows
#Two dictionaries are created:-one containing starting lines of all the verses and second one containing all possible lines other than the starting lines in the verses(All this lines are included in the 12th verse and here they are ordered in the reverse order of that in the 12th verse)
#A function to recite a verse when the verse number is given is defined first. First verse is created by selecting the value corresponding to the first key in the first dictionary as it does not contain any line from the second dictionary. Other verses are created by joining the value corresponding to the key in the first dictionary whose value equal to the verse number and first (verse number-1) lines from the second dictionary(these values are added in reverse order). Thus nth verse is formed by joining the value corresponding to the nth key in the first dictionary and first (n-1) values from the second dictionary 
#If the starting verse and ending verse are same it means that only one verse is to returned. This can be obtained by just calling the function for creating a verse when verse number is given
#When starting verse and ending verse are not same, it means that verses from the starting verse to the ending verse should be returned. For this verse corresponding to each verse in the range (start_verse,end_verse+1) is obtained(Here one is added to end_verse because range function will increment only upto one less than the maximum range value i.e. end_verse-1 in this case. But verse including that corresponding to end_verse is required. So simply using end_verse in the range function will cause error). Then the verses are joined
